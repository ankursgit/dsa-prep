## Question 1: 
    - Code:
        i = 1;
        while(i<=n)
        {
            i = i*3;
        }


    - Analysis to calculate number of operations:

        After 0 iterations, i = 1 = 3^0
        After 1 iteration,  i = 3 = 3^1
        After 2 iterations, i = 9 = 3^2
        After 3 iterations, i = 27 = 3^3
        ...
        ...
        After kth iteration, i = 3^k

        From condition we know loop shall run untill i <= n
        After kth iteration:
            i >= n
            3^k >= n
        taking log3 both sides
        
        k >= log3(n)

        Big O:
            log_3(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(3)
            log_3(n) = .63 * log_2(n)
            
            O(log(n))

        COmplexity = O(log(n))
