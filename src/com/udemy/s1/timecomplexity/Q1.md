## Question 1: 
    - Code:
        i = 1;
        while(i<=n)
        {
            i = i*2;
        }


    - Analysis to calculate number of operations:

        After 0 iterations, i = 1 = 2^0
        After 1 iteration,  i = 2 = 2^1
        After 2 iterations, i = 4 = 2^2
        After 3 iterations, i = 8 = 2^3
        ...
        ...
        After kth iteration, i = 2^k

        From condition we know loop shall run untill i <= n
        After kth iteration:
            i >= n
            2^k >= n
        taking log2 both sides
        
        k >= log2(n)

        COmplexity = O(log(n))
